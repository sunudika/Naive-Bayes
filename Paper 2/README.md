You'll need to download :
1. monk_uji.csv 
2. monk.csv
3. Naive_Bayes_Program.py

in case you want to run it on your own computer/laptop.
we've already added comment to each row of the code, and you can read the jupyter notebook file inorder to explain you don't understand while you learn the code. Happy Coding!
