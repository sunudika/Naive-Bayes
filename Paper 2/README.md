You'll need to download :
1. monk_uji.csv 
2. monk.csv
3. Naive_Bayes_Program.py

in case you want to run it on your own computer/laptop.
we've already added comment to each row of the code, and you can read the jupyter notebook file inorder to explain what you can't understand while you learn the code. Happy Coding!
